      Hello! It's great to hear that you are learning programming languages and cybersecurity. Creating a community to
      learn and share knowledge is an excellent initiative. It can be overwhelming for newcomers to know where and how
      to start in the field of hacking. By collaborating and learning together, you can simplify the learning process
      and support each other's growth. Remember to correct mistakes and continuously improve your vocabulary. Keep up
      the good work, and happy learning! </p>
